"""
Class for working with the Flask app.cfg file.
app.cfg files for Flask apps differ from the config files formatted for use by the ConfigParser package as follows:
1. Flask configurations lack sections.
2. String values are wrapped in single quotes, which ConfigParser treats as characters.

This class looks for a file named "app.cfg" in the instance directory.

           the configuration file must not be in the repo.
